Fetching BRIR
Processing: chanson_51k2
--> Reference sound reconstruction
--> Convolution RI*Sound
--> Synchronising sounds
+ looking for signal energy per band of 100 points
	(will just look at the first quarter of the signal)
+ Generating energy report plot
+ Computing shifting to apply
	Chosen start for convoluted sound : 49500
	Chosen start for reference sound : 49500
	Chosen length for both sounds : 8.96e+05
+ Generating temporaly synchronized signals plot
